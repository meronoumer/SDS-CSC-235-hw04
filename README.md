# SDS-CSC-235-hw04: Choose Your Own Adventure 

## Outline

This repository contains the starter code and instructions you will need for this assignment; fork and then clone it to your machine. You do not have to, but working with a partner is recommended for this assignment.   

Now that you've gained more experience with visual analytic analysis and front end web development, you're ready to start finding your niche. In this assignment, you will choose one of the analysis topics we've covered recently and build a (small) visual analytic system to support a domain expert in performing a visual analysis. 

This repository includes blank `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js` files that you will need to modify to build your visual analytic system. A good starting point for D3 reference is [D3 in Depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/introduction/), but there are plenty of additional free resources available. Remember, we are using version 7 of D3 (older resources may use previous versions, with methods that are no longer supported). For reference, you have slides from class and example code as well.   

## Phase 1: Topic  

Your visual analysis system must support at least one of the following:
- Network analysis
- Geospatial analysis
- Visualizing uncertainty 
- Real-time bias mitigation 

The data you use is completely up to you. It is recommended that you select a dataset that is large enough to be interesting, but not so large you have a difficult time working with it. A good way to gauge is to do exploratory data analysis, and to make sure you can envison a VA system that meets the requirements listed below using the data you chose. 

If you need to do any data pre-processing (cleaning, analysis, etc.) you should do that in your language of choice prior to building your system. In other words, do not try to use JavaScript to clean and process your data. 

## Phase 2: VA System 

The visual analytics system you create must:

1. Be built using D3
2. Be properly titled and labeled 
3. Include at least two visualization elements 
4. Include appropriate visual encoding of data 
5. Include at least two different types of interaction 
6. Meaningfully support at least one of the VA topics listed above


Before building your system, you should plan what visualizations you will use, how they will be laid out, and how a user would interact with your system. Include a sketch detailing your plan in your repository. Your sketch can be simple or detailed, but keep in mind a detailed sketch can get you credit for good ideas that you were not able to implement perfectly while a bare-bones sketch cannot. 

After building your system be sure to test it. To do this:

1. Write down two specific analysis tasks you could ask someone to do with your system. For example, can you identify two cliques in this network? 


-  Which airline receives the greatest number of negative tweets?


-  For a selected airline, which complaint category appears most frequently?
2. Ask a classmate or friend to perform the tasks, one by one. As they do, take notes. What do they find intuative about your system? What confuses them? Do any unexpected bugs arise? 

 - 
My interviewee correctly responded United. They then said the size difference + the color mapping was intuitive and helped them immediately see the largest size in the barplot.

However , for the second question the linkage between our visualizations had an unexpected bug which didn't allow our user to filter and discover more information on a select airline.


3. Pick one reasonable adjustment to make to your system based on your testing. Implement that adjustment. 

Be sure to record your answers for the three steps above. Include a text file in your submission with your answers. 


 ## Submission

 If this is your first submission of this assignment: fill out `rubric.md`, push your completed files to github, and submit your repo on Gradescope.

 If this is a revised submission of this assignment: fill out `reflection.md`, `rubric.md`, push your completed files to github, and submit your repo on Gradescope. 

## Note to users

To run this project, navigate to the directory where you have cloned this project then type into your terminal the following line

```python -m http.server```

This will open port 8000 which you can access through [this link](http://localhost:8000/SDS-CSC-235-hw04/) and view the data visualizations.
